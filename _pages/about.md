I'm a Data Engineer at [eXate](https://www.exate.com/), a London-based data privacy and security company. I design scalable pipelines and build solutions that help organisations to protect sensitive data at scale.

Prior to this, I completed a PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Waikato](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/) in Hamilton, New Zealand. [My research](https://hdl.handle.net/10289/17049) focused on developing visualisation techniques for categorical data and validating those techniques through applications in linguistics.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, travelling, playing games (but weirdly, not gaming), exploring the outdoors and generally keeping active. Did I mention I have a chocolate addiction? 
My family and friends can attest to my razor-sharp wit and likeability, not to mention my modesty!

As a self-professed language nerd from Aotearoa, I have researched aspects of New Zealand English (NZE) and [te reo Māori](https://maorilanguage.info/description-of-maori/). Check out [Kiwi Words](https://kiwiwords.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) for more information about related projects.
